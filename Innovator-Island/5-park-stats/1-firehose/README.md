# Module 5: Analyzing visitor stats - (1) Configure Kinesis Firehose

*[Click here](../README.md) to return the main instructions for Module 5 at any time.*

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service that reliably loads streaming data into data lakes, data stores and analytics tools. It can capture, transform, and load streaming data into Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk, enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools like Amazon QuickSight.

It automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing administration. You can configure a delivery stream and start sending data from hundreds of thousands of data sources to be loaded continuously to AWS â€“ all in just a few minutes. 

## Inside this section

This section shows how to set up and configure a Kinesis Firehose delivery stream. Once this is complete, you can send events to this stream and they will be stored in S3 for analysis.
